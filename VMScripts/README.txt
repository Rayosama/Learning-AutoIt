One of the first big roadblocks I came across was that I couldn't use my computer while the scripts were running because the script actually used my cursor. So to counteract this, I learned how to set up my own VM on my computer that would be used solely for running my scripts. Once I got that running, I was going to rewrite all my previous scripts and update the locations to the new ones on my second monitor. After working on one, I decided to modify all my other scripts instead of being hard coded for the locations and colors. I made it so you would be able to use a function and reassign the values. This way, it didn't matter your screen size or location of the client you're playing on. You'd be able to fire up the script and it would work for you!
