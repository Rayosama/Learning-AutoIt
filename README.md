# Learning-AutoIt
A collection of scripts I have been making in my spare time for fun!
I have been really busy, and haven't been able to game as much as a wanted, but still wanted to be able to progress. That's when I discovered AutoIt. I have been learning this simple but extremly powerful language to create bots that will play the game for me. The game I created these for is Dreamscape which can be found here (https://dreamscape317.net/), which is a private server of the game Runescape which can be found here (https://www.runescape.com/community). In these scripts, at the core of what I have done is used a mixture of fixed locations on the screen, and pixel searching for specific colors. With this I have been able to automate teleportation, fighting, and any other repetitive task that you could think of in a game of this type!
